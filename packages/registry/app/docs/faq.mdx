To help improve the CLI experience, Dot UI collects anonymous usage telemetry by default. This data helps us understand how the CLI is being used and identify areas for improvement.

### What data is collected

The telemetry system tracks:
- Component installation events (success/failure)
- Project initialization events
- Framework type (Next.js or Vite)
- TypeScript and Tailwind CSS usage
- Package manager used (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun)
- Operation duration (for performance improvements)
- CLI version
- Error messages (truncated to protect sensitive data)

### Privacy

- **No personal information** is collected (no usernames, project names, or file paths)
- **No code or component content** is transmitted
- Data is only used in aggregate to improve the CLI
- Telemetry **fails silently** and will never break your CLI operations

### Disabling telemetry

You can disable telemetry in several ways:

**Environment variable (recommended):**
```bash
export POLKA_UI_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true
```

**Per-command using dev flag:**
```bash
npx polkadot-ui add button --dev
```

**Permanently in your shell profile:**
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.
export POLKA_UI_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true
```

Telemetry is automatically disabled when using the `--dev` flag for local development.
